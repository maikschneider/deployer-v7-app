Flatten structure of databases settings for database tasks.

Structure was:
::

 set(
       'db_databases',
       [
           ['database_foo' => [
                   'host' => '127.0.0.1',
                   'database' => 'foo',
                   'user' => 'foo',
                   'password' => 'foopass',
                  ]
           ],
           ['database_foo' => get('db_default')]
           ['database_bar' => [
                   'host' => '127.0.0.1',
                   'database' => 'bar',
                   'user' => 'bar',
                   'password' => 'barpass',
                  ],
           ],
           ['database_bar' => get('db_default')]
           ['database_bar' => '/absolute/path/to/file/with/config_array.php']
       ]
   );

Should be now:
::

 set(
       'db_databases',
       [
           'database_foo' => [
               [
                   'host' => '127.0.0.1',
                   'database' => 'foo',
                   'user' => 'foo',
                   'password' => 'foopass',
               ],
               get('db_default'),
               '/absolute/path/to/file/with/config_array.php'
           ],
           'database_bar' => [
               get('db_default'),
               '/absolute/path/to/file/with/config_array.php'
           ],
       ]
   );

All of the arrays in each database defined by key will be merged.
